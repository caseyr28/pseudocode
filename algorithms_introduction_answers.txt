Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;
  A: 
    SET coffee
    SET water
    SET beans
    INIT groundBeans to zero    
    INIT coffeeMaker to empty
    INIT full to capacity
    IF water equals empty
      INCREMENT water to full
    END IF
    WHILE beans are not groundBeans
      INCREMENT beans to groundBeans
    END WHILE
    ADD groundBeans to coffeeMaker
    water PLUS coffeeMaker equals coffee



Washing dishes;
A choice of your own.
As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

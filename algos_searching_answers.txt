What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
  A:A real-life linear search example would be finding the gift you asked Santa for, by opening all your gifts one at 
  a time form under the Chrsitmas tree.

What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
  A:A real-life example of a binary search would be searching for a specific name in a phone book.

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to 
find the value G using linear search?
  A: 7

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find 
the value G using binary search?
  A: 3

Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and 
binary search? Explain your reasoning.
  A: I would choose a linear search. Even though it's a large list, it is unsorted, so a binary search would not work.

Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary 
search? Explain your reasoning.
  A: I would choose a binary search, because the list is sorted, so finding a result would be much faster with a binary search.

You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. 
Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
  A:
  var dictionary = [
  'albanian',
  'albano',
  'albany',
  'albarello',
  'albarium',
  'albata',
  'albategnius',
  'albatross',
  'albay',
  'albedo',
  'albedometer',
  'albee',
  'albee',
  'albeit',
  'albemarle',
  'albeniz',
  'albergo',
  'alberich',
  'alberoni',
  'albers',
  'albert',  
  ]

  var dictionarySearch = function(collection, value){
    let low = collection[0]
    let high = collection[collection.length - 1]

    while (low <= high) {
      let mid = (collection.indexOf(low) + collection.indexOf(high)) / 2
      mid = Math.round(mid)

      if (collection[mid] > value) {
        high = collection[mid - 1]
      } else if (collection[mid] < value) {
        low = collection[mid + 1]
      } else {
        return collection[mid]
      }
    }
    return "Not found"
  }

  dictionarySearch(dictionary, 'albatross')

You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. 
Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
  A:
  var fishTank = [
    'fishA',
    'fishB',
    'fishC', 
    'fishD',
    'fishE',
    'fishF',
    'WhiteSpottedGoldfish',
    'fishH',
    'fishI',               
  ]

  var findCorrectFish = function(arr, value) {
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i] === value) {
        return arr[i]
      }
    }
    return "Sorry kid, that fish is dead."
  }


  findCorrectFish(fishTank, 'WhiteSpottedGoldfish')
